# PaymentFlow AI — Engineering Repository Blueprint (ERB)

**Purpose**  
This Engineering Repository Blueprint (ERB) is the official engineering handbook for PaymentFlow AI. It defines repository layout, collaboration workflows, coding standards, architecture patterns, CI/CD, security, testing, and onboarding. It is written for engineers, architects, DevOps, AI teams, security, and new hires so they can contribute immediately and safely to a global, production-grade fintech platform.

### SECTION 1 — ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

#### Mission
**Deliver a secure, auditable, and scalable AI-powered fintech platform** that enables consumers, freelancers, SMEs, and enterprises to move, manage, and optimize money globally while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational excellence.

#### Engineering Principles
- **Safety and Compliance First** — Every design decision must consider regulatory, privacy, and audit requirements.
- **Domain Ownership** — Teams own domains end-to-end including code, infra, data contracts, and SLAs.
- **Small, Composable Services** — Prefer focused services with clear APIs and event contracts.
- **Observable by Default** — Instrumentation, tracing, and metrics are required for all services.
- **Automate Everything** — Tests, builds, deployments, security scans, and compliance checks are automated.
- **Design for Failure** — Assume external systems fail; design retries, circuit breakers, and fallbacks.
- **Data Integrity Above All** — Ledger-first approach, idempotency, and strong transactional guarantees for money flows.

#### Code Quality Standards
- **Type safety** across services (TypeScript, Python typing).
- **Linting and formatting** enforced in CI.
- **Comprehensive tests** with coverage gates.
- **API contracts** are added in OpenAPI, with event schemas in a central registry, when implementation of the owning domain begins.
- **Peer review** mandatory for all changes.

#### Architecture Principles
- **Ledger-first**: All money movements recorded in immutable journals.
- **Event-driven**: Kafka for domain events and CDC to analytics.
- **Multi-region active-active**: Stateless services across regions; stateful services with replication and sharding.
- **Separation of concerns**: Clear separation between transactional, analytical, and AI workloads.

#### Scalability Principles
- **Autoscaling** for stateless services and inference clusters.
- **Sharding** for high-volume tables and tenant isolation for large customers.
- **CQRS**: Separate read models for analytics and dashboards.
- **Backpressure**: API gateway and queue-based throttling.

#### Security First Philosophy
- **Zero trust** network and least privilege access.
- **Encryption** in transit and at rest.
- **Secrets management** via Vault.
- **Continuous security scanning** and annual red team exercises.

#### Developer Experience Philosophy
- **Fast feedback loops**: local dev environments, hot reload, and test runners.
- **Clear onboarding**: scripts and docs to get running in hours.
- **Shared tooling**: CLI, code generators, and templates to reduce cognitive load.

**Why these principles exist**  
They ensure financial correctness, regulatory compliance, operational resilience, and developer productivity at scale. They reduce risk, speed delivery, and make the platform maintainable for years.

```

#### Directory purposes
- **apps** — Frontend applications and consumer-facing clients. Each app is a deployable artifact.
  - **web** — Business web app and dashboards.
  - **mobile** — React Native or native wrappers.
  - **admin** — Admin portal for KYC, fraud, and operations.
  - **marketing** — Marketing site and landing pages.
- **services** — Backend microservices. Each service is a self-contained module with its own tests, Dockerfile, and deployment manifests.
- **packages** — Shared libraries and utilities published internally or consumed by apps and services.
  - **ui** — Reusable UI components.
  - **design-system** — Tokens, themes, and guidelines.
  - **shared-types** — TypeScript types and OpenAPI-generated types.
  - **shared-utils** — Utilities for logging, errors, validation.
  - **database** — Prisma schemas, migrations helpers, and DB utilities.
  - **api-sdk** — Generated SDKs for internal and external consumption.
  - **eslint-config** and **tsconfig** — Centralized lint and TypeScript configs.
- **infra** — Infrastructure as code and deployment artifacts.
  - **docker** — Base images and build helpers.
  - **kubernetes** — Helm charts and K8s manifests.
  - **terraform** — Cloud resources and state management.
  - **helm** — Chart templates for services.
- **.github/workflows** — CI/CD pipelines.
- **scripts** — Developer scripts for bootstrapping, migrations, and local orchestration.
- **tools** — CLI tools, code generators, and devops helpers.
- **docs** — Architecture docs, runbooks, and onboarding guides.

#### Monorepo rules
- **Single source of truth** for each implemented shared type and API contract; planned contracts must not be presented as existing artifacts.
- **Per-service ownership**: each service team owns its folder and CI jobs.
- **Atomic PRs**: changes touching multiple services must include coordinated tests and migration plans.
- **Versioning**: packages use semantic versioning; services use independent versioning.

        controllers/
        services/
        repositories/

### SECTION 7 — DATABASE LAYER

#### Prisma organization
- **Monorepo package** `packages/database` contains Prisma schemas per domain and shared models.
- **Per-service Prisma client** generated from domain-specific schema to enforce data ownership.

#### Migration strategy
- **Migrations** stored in `packages/database/migrations`.
- **CI** runs migrations in staging; production migrations require manual approval and run via deployment pipeline.
- **Backward compatibility**: Additive migrations preferred; destructive changes via multi-step migration with feature flags.

#### Seed strategy
- **Dev seeds** for local dev with realistic but anonymized data.
- **Test seeds** for CI integration tests.
- **Production seeds** only for essential reference data (currencies, roles).

#### Repository pattern
- **Repositories** encapsulate Prisma queries and transactions.
- **Unit of work** pattern for multi-repository transactions.

#### Transaction handling
- **Ledger transactions** use explicit DB transactions and optimistic locking.
- **Two-phase commit** avoided; use compensating transactions for external systems.

#### Database versioning
- **Schema version** tracked in `schema_migrations` table and in Git tags.

---

---

### SECTION 17 — CODING STANDARDS

#### TypeScript rules
- **Strict mode** enabled.
- **No any** except with justification.
- **Prefer readonly** and `as const`.
- **Example**
```ts
// Good
type Currency = 'USD' | 'EUR';
const formatAmount = (amount: number): string => amount.toFixed(2);

// Bad
function format(a) { return a; } // no types
```

#### React rules
- **Functional components** with hooks.
- **Presentational vs container** separation.
- **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- **Example**
```tsx
// Good
function Button({label, onClick}: {label: string; onClick: () => void}) {
  return <button onClick={onClick} aria-label={label}>{label}</button>;
}
```

#### NestJS rules
- **Modules per domain**, controllers thin, services own logic.
- **DTOs** with Zod or class-validator.
- **Example**
```ts
@Controller('wallets')
export class WalletController {
  constructor(private readonly walletService: WalletService) {}
  @Post()
  create(@Body() dto: CreateWalletDto) { return this.walletService.create(dto); }
}
```

#### Python rules
- **Type hints** and linting with `ruff` and `mypy`.
- **FastAPI** endpoints typed and documented.

#### SQL and Prisma rules
- **Use parameterized queries**.
- **NUMERIC** for money with explicit precision.
- **Prisma** migrations reviewed and tested.

#### API design rules
- **Use nouns** for resources.
- **Idempotency** for create endpoints.
- **Use RFC7807** for errors.

#### Documentation

### Closing notes

This Engineering Repository Blueprint is the canonical guide for building PaymentFlow AI. It balances security, compliance, and developer velocity. It is intentionally prescriptive where financial correctness matters and flexible where teams need autonomy. The next steps are:

- Approve the ERB by CTO and Security.
- Create initial repo scaffold and CI templates.
- Run a pilot onboarding with 2–3 engineers to validate the developer experience.
