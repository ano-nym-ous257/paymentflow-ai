# SECTION 1: SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### Product Architecture Overview
**PaymentFlow AI** is a modular, microservices-based fintech platform built for global scale and regulatory compliance. It exposes secure REST/gRPC APIs to client apps (Consumer Mobile, Business Web, Admin Portal), integrates with external payment rails and FX providers, and embeds AI services for decisioning, forecasting, and a Financial Copilot. The platform is event-driven (Kafka) with a strong ledger-first design (immutable, auditable journal) and multi-region deployment for high availability and low latency.

**High-level components**
- **Client Layer:** Mobile apps, web apps, admin consoles.
- **API Gateway & Edge:** Authentication, rate limiting, routing, WAF.
- **Microservices:** Auth, User, Wallet, Payment, Transaction, Beneficiary, Invoice, Payroll, Treasury, Routing, Fraud, Analytics, AI Copilot, Compliance, Audit, Notification, Admin.
- **Data Plane:** PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache), Kafka (events), S3-compatible object store.
- **AI Platform:** Model serving, feature store, prompt orchestration, secure data access.
- **Infra & Ops:** Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, multi-region clusters, observability stack.

### Core System Objectives
1. **Scale** to millions of users and billions in transaction volume.
2. **High availability** with multi-region active-active deployment.
3. **Financial integrity** via banking-grade ledger and double-entry bookkeeping.
4. **Security & compliance** (KYC/KYB, AML, PCI DSS, GDPR).
5. **AI-driven decisioning** for fraud, routing, forecasting, and user assistance.
6. **Operational transparency** for auditors and regulators.

### Business Capabilities
- Consumer and business accounts with multi-currency wallets.
- Cross-border payments with smart routing and FX optimization.
- Treasury management and liquidity forecasting.
- Invoicing, payroll, and reconciliation.
- Real-time fraud detection and compliance workflows.
- AI Financial Copilot for insights, forecasting, and recommendations.
- Admin operations for KYC, AML, and audit.

### Technical Goals
- **Resilience:** 99.99% platform availability SLA for core payment flows.
- **Latency:** <200ms API p95 for core account/wallet operations; <2s for payment initiation.
- **Throughput:** Support thousands of TPS per region; burst to tens of thousands with autoscaling.
- **Consistency:** Strong consistency for ledger and balance operations; eventual consistency for analytics.
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption, MFA, RBAC, zero-trust network.

### Design Principles
- **Separation of concerns:** Single responsibility microservices.
- **Event-driven:** Decoupled services via Kafka for reliability and auditability.
- **Ledger-first:** All money movements recorded in immutable journal entries.
- **Idempotency & retries:** All external interactions are idempotent and retriable.
- **Least privilege & zero trust:** Minimal access, mutual TLS, service identity.
- **Regulatory-by-design:** Data partitioning, retention, and audit trails built-in.
- **AI safety & privacy:** Controlled data access, model explainability, and audit logs.

### Why this architecture
- **Microservices + event-driven** enables independent scaling of payment, fraud, and AI workloads.
- **Ledger-first** ensures financial correctness and auditability required for banking operations.
- **Multi-region active-active** reduces latency and supports regulatory data residency.
- **AI microservices** separated from core ledger to avoid model-induced state drift and to allow explainability and governance.

# SECTION 5: PAYMENT ARCHITECTURE

### Payment processing workflows — overview
Payments are orchestrated by Payment Service, validated by Fraud Service, routed by Routing Service, and recorded in the Ledger. All state transitions are evented to Kafka.

---

## Send Money Flow (Consumer P2P)

**Sequence diagram (textual)**
```
1. Client -> API Gateway -> Payment Service (POST /payments)
2. Payment Service -> Auth Service (validate token)
3. Payment Service -> Wallet Service (debit hold)
4. Payment Service -> Fraud Service (sync score)
   - If high risk -> create Fraud Alert, hold payment, notify Admin
5. Payment Service -> Ledger Service (create pending journal entries)
6. Payment Service -> Transaction Service (create transaction record)
7. Payment Service -> Routing Service (if external)
8. Payment Service -> External Provider (if needed)
9. External Provider -> Webhook -> Payment Service (settlement)
10. Payment Service -> Ledger Service (settle journal entries)
11. Notification Service -> User (success/failure)
```

**Failure handling**
- **Debit hold fails:** return error; idempotent retry up to N times.
- **Fraud high risk:** payment moved to manual review; TTL-based auto-cancel.
- **External provider failure:** retry with exponential backoff; failover to alternate provider via Routing Service.
- **Partial settlement:** create partial settlement journal entries; notify user.

**Retry mechanisms**
- Idempotency keys for client requests.
- Exponential backoff with jitter for external calls.
- Dead-letter queue (Kafka DLQ) for manual intervention.

---

## Receive Money Flow (Merchant / Wallet top-up)

**Sequence**
1. Payer initiates via external rail -> External Provider -> Webhook -> Payment Service.
2. Payment Service validates webhook signature -> Transaction Service -> Ledger (credit merchant wallet).
3. Notification to merchant; reconciliation job marks invoice paid if applicable.

**Failure handling**
- Webhook signature invalid -> reject and log.
- Duplicate webhook -> idempotency check.

---

## Cross-Border Payment Flow

**Sequence**
1. Payment Service receives cross-border request.
2. Payment Service -> Routing Service -> select provider(s) based on cost/latency/success.
3. Payment Service -> FX Service (if conversion required) -> obtain rate and reserve FX.
4. Payment Service -> Fraud Service (enhanced checks).
5. Payment Service -> Treasury Service (if large amount, check liquidity).
6. Payment Service -> External Provider(s) -> settlement.
7. Ledger entries: debit sender wallet, credit settlement account, record FX gains/losses.
8. Reconciliation and settlement with correspondent banks.

**Failure handling**
- FX rate expired -> re-quote and require user confirmation for large deltas.
- Provider failure -> fallback to alternate provider; if none, refund or hold.
- Regulatory block -> escalate to Compliance Service.

**Retries**
- Provider retries with backoff; multi-provider parallel attempts for critical payments.

---

## Payroll Flow

**Sequence**
1. Business schedules payroll -> Payroll Service validates employees and tax rules.
2. Payroll Service -> Payment Service (bulk payment job) with idempotency.
3. Payment Service -> Wallet/Ledger -> create holds and journal entries.
4. Payment Service -> External rails for salary disbursement.
5. Payroll Service -> Notification (payslips).
6. Reconciliation and tax reporting via Compliance Service.

**Failure handling**
- Insufficient funds -> partial run with prioritized payments; notify admin.
- Tax calculation errors -> rollback and manual correction.

---

## Invoice Payment Flow

**Sequence**
1. Customer clicks invoice pay link -> Payment Service -> Payment initiation.
2. Payment Service -> Invoice Service -> mark invoice as paid on settlement.
3. Ledger entries and reconciliation.

**Failure handling**
- Payment failure -> retry and send reminders; create dispute if chargeback.

---

## Payment Request Flow

**Sequence**
1. Sender creates payment request via Invoice/Payment Service.
2. Recipient receives notification and pays via Consumer App or external link.
3. Payment Service processes as above.

**Failure handling**
- Expired requests -> auto-cancel; reissue option.

---

# SECTION 6: WALLET ARCHITECTURE

### Multi-currency wallets
- Each wallet supports multiple currency balances (USD, EUR, GBP, GHS, NGN, KES).
- **Model:** Wallet entity with sub-balances per currency; each currency balance is backed by ledger accounts.

### Wallet lifecycle
1. **Create:** Wallet Service creates wallet record and default currency sub-accounts.
2. **Activate:** KYC/KYB checks complete; wallet activated.
3. **Fund:** Funding via bank transfer/card/third-party; ledger entries created.
4. **Hold/Reserve:** For pending payments, funds are placed on hold (separate ledger account).
5. **Close:** Sweep balances to settlement account; archive wallet; retain audit logs.

### Ledger architecture (wallet interactions)
- **Accounts per wallet per currency:** `wallet:{id}:{currency}:available`, `wallet:{id}:{currency}:hold`.
- **Journal entries** record debits/credits with immutable IDs and references to transactions.

### Balance updates
- **Strong consistency:** Balance updates are performed via the Ledger Service using database transactions and optimistic locking.
- **Hot reads:** Redis cache stores available balances for fast reads; cache invalidated/updated on ledger commit.
- **Holds:** Implemented as separate ledger accounts to avoid race conditions.

### Reconciliation strategy
- **Daily reconciliation:** Compare ledger balances with external settlement accounts and provider statements.
- **Continuous reconciliation:** Stream provider settlement events into Kafka; reconcile in near real-time.
- **Discrepancy handling:** Auto-create reconciliation tickets; Treasury/Accounting workflows for manual resolution.

### Double-entry bookkeeping implementation
- **Principle:** Every financial event creates at least two journal entries (debit and credit) that sum to zero in base currency after FX adjustments.
- **Implementation details:**
  - **Journal table** stores immutable entries: `journal_id`, `timestamp`, `debit_account`, `credit_account`, `amount`, `currency`, `fx_rate`, `reference`, `status`.
  - **Atomicity:** Ledger Service wraps journal writes in DB transactions; uses two-phase commit pattern when interacting with external systems (or compensating transactions).
  - **Balance derivation:** Balances are computed by aggregating journal entries per account; cached snapshots maintained for performance.
  - **Idempotency:** Each external event includes an idempotency key to prevent duplicate journal entries.

---

# SECTION 7: LEDGER DESIGN

### Requirements recap
- Immutable transactions
- Auditability
- Atomic updates
- Multi-currency support

### Ledger tables (schema summary)
- **accounts**
  - `account_id` (PK), `account_type`, `owner_id`, `currency`, `created_at`, `status`
- **journals**
  - `journal_id` (PK), `created_at`, `reference_id`, `narration`, `source_service`, `status`
- **journal_entries**
  - `entry_id` (PK), `journal_id` (FK), `account_id` (FK), `debit_credit` (D/C), `amount`, `currency`, `fx_rate`, `base_amount`, `created_at`
- **balances_snapshot**
  - `account_id`, `currency`, `balance`, `as_of`, `version`
- **ledger_audit**
  - `audit_id`, `journal_id`, `hash`, `previous_hash`, `signed_by`, `timestamp`

### Journal entries
- Each `journal` groups related `journal_entries`.
- `journal_entries` are immutable once committed.
- Journals include cryptographic hash chain (`previous_hash`) for tamper-evidence.

### Debit/Credit workflows
- **Create transaction:** Payment Service requests Ledger Service to create a journal with entries.
- **Validation:** Ledger validates accounts, currency, and sufficient funds (for debits).
- **Commit:** Ledger writes journal and entries in a single DB transaction; updates `balances_snapshot` atomically.
- **Publish:** On commit, Ledger publishes `PaymentSettled` event to Kafka.

### Balance calculations
- **Primary source:** `balances_snapshot` for fast reads.
- **Recompute:** Periodic recompute from `journal_entries` for integrity checks.
- **FX handling:** Each entry stores `fx_rate` and `base_amount` (platform base currency) for consolidated reporting.

### Reconciliation process
- **Intra-platform:** Reconcile wallet balances vs ledger snapshots hourly.
- **External:** Reconcile ledger settlement accounts vs bank/provider statements daily.
- **Automated matching:** Use transaction references and amounts; unmatched items flagged for manual review.

### Ledger integrity guarantees
- **ACID transactions:** Postgres with strong transactional guarantees for journal writes.
- **Append-only journals:** Once committed, journals are immutable; updates are via compensating journals.
- **Hash chaining:** Each journal includes a cryptographic hash linking to previous journal for tamper detection.
- **Audit trail:** Audit Service stores signed copies of journals and access logs.
- **Periodic attestation:** Automated integrity checks and Merkle-tree style proofs for auditors.

---

# SECTION 8: FRAUD DETECTION ARCHITECTURE

### Objectives
- Real-time scoring for payments and account actions.
- Multi-layer detection: rules, ML models, device intelligence, velocity checks.
- Provide explainable decisions and escalation to manual review.

### Components
- **Risk Engine (real-time):** Executes rules and ML model inference synchronously for low-latency decisions.
- **Behavior Analysis:** Long-term user behavior models (session patterns, spending habits).
- **Velocity Monitoring:** Counters for transaction frequency, amount thresholds, rapid beneficiary additions.
- **Device Intelligence:** Device fingerprinting, IP reputation, geolocation anomalies.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Unsupervised models for outlier detection.
- **Decision Engine:** Aggregates scores, applies thresholds, and outputs actions (allow, challenge, block, manual review).

`

`

### Scoring architecture
- **Feature store:** Real-time features (last N transactions, avg amount, velocity) stored in Redis/feature store.
- **Model inference:** Lightweight models (XGBoost/LightGBM) served via model server; heavier models in GPU cluster for batch scoring.
- **Score composition:** `final_score = w_rules*rule_score + w_ml*ml_score + w_device*device_score`
- **Risk levels:** Low (<0.3), Medium (0.3–0.7), High (>0.7) — thresholds configurable per region/merchant.

### Decision architecture
- **Synchronous path:** Payment Service calls Fraud Service; Fraud Service returns decision and recommended action.
- **Asynchronous path:** For complex cases, create a Fraud Alert and continue with hold until manual review.
- **Explainability:** Fraud Service returns feature contributions and rule hits for audit.

### Fraud workflow diagram (textual)
```
Payment -> Fraud Service -> Feature Fetch -> Model Inference -> Decision
If Medium -> 2FA challenge or additional verification
If High -> Hold payment, create case in Fraud Center, notify Admin
```

### Data sources
- Transaction history, device signals, external threat feeds, watchlists, KYC data.

### Feedback loop
- Outcomes (chargebacks, confirmed fraud) are fed back into model training pipelines to improve detection.

  - **Specialized models** for forecasting (Transformer time-series), anomaly detection (autoencoders), and recommendations (graph-based).
  - **Model registry** with versioning and A/B testing.
- **Serving:** Model servers behind an inference gateway; GPU nodes for heavy models; CPU for lightweight.

### Caching strategy
- **Prompt result cache:** Cache deterministic responses for repeated queries (short TTL).
- **Feature cache:** Feature store caches precomputed features for low-latency inference.
- **Context cache:** Redis for session context.

### Security controls
- **Data minimization:** Only necessary data passed to models; PII redaction where possible.
- **Access controls:** Models access data via service accounts with least privilege.
- **Explainability logs:** All model inputs/outputs logged (hashed) for audit.
- **Model governance:** Approval workflows for model deployment; drift monitoring.

### How AI accesses financial data safely
- **Controlled APIs:** AI services access data via internal service APIs with RBAC and mTLS.
- **Encryption:** Data in transit and at rest encrypted; keys managed in Vault.
- **Anonymization:** For non-essential tasks, data is anonymized or aggregated.
- **Audit:** All AI queries and responses logged to Audit Service.

---

# SECTION 10: SMART ROUTING ARCHITECTURE

### Routing decision factors
- **Cost:** Fees and FX margins.
- **Latency:** Expected settlement time.
- **Success Rate:** Historical success per provider per corridor.
- **Country & Currency:** Provider coverage and regulatory constraints.
- **Provider Reliability:** SLA, maintenance windows.
- **Time of day / liquidity:** Provider liquidity and cut-off times.

### Routing architecture
- **Routing Service** maintains provider metrics (ingested from Analytics).
- **Decision engine** computes a score per provider:
  - `score = α*(1-cost_rank) + β*(success_rate) + γ*(1-latency_rank) + δ*(reliability)`
- **Constraints:** Regulatory constraints and sanctions screening applied before selection.
- **Fallbacks:** If primary provider fails, attempt secondary providers in ranked order; parallel attempts for high-value payments.

`

`

### Fallback strategies
- **Soft-failover:** Retry with alternate provider after transient errors.
- **Parallel routing:** For critical payments, send to multiple providers and accept first success (optimistic routing).
- **Escalation:** If no provider available, hold and notify Treasury for manual routing.

---

# SECTION 11: TREASURY INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE

### Objectives
- Cash forecasting, liquidity management, settlement optimization, currency exposure analysis, AI recommendations.
